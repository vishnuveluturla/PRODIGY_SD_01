# Number Guessing Game

## Overview:
This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The game generates a random number between a specified range and prompts the player to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Features:
- Random number generation within a specified range.
- User input for guessing the number.
- Feedback on the correctness of the guess.
- Option to play again after guessing the correct number.
- Error handling for invalid user inputs.

## Technologies Used:
- Java Programming Language
- Java Standard Library

## Getting Started:
To run the game, you'll need:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java files using the command:
   ```
   javac NumberGuessingGame.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled program using the command:
   ```
   java NumberGuessingGame
   ```

## Usage:
1. Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to enter the minimum and maximum values for the range of numbers.
2. Once the range is set, the game will generate a random number within that range.
3. You'll then be prompted to guess the number.
4. Enter your guess, and the game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.
6. After guessing the correct number, you'll have the option to play again or exit the game.

## Contribution:
